# SOM_ACP
This project was carried out as part of a final year project to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Multidisciplinary Faculty of Larache - Morocco in 2014.
In this work we try to develop a system for pattern classification and recognition, this work is based on artificial neural networks and mathematical method of data analysis ACP to develop a software model that works in two modes, classic mode uses classical algorithm known and enhanced mode that combines both ACP algorithm and the learning algorithm of the SOM map.
